18:40:25 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §rEver wondered how I find all the things that other players lost? I outsource it. Right now, someone is looking for their §9Enchanted Red Mushroom Block§f. Can you find that for me?
18:40:28 §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §rIt's Saturday, my resting day! I earned myself a little treat, maybe you could bring me some chocolate?
18:40:31 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fHey §bSebbebas§f, the mayor elections are coming up and I've ran out of ballot paper! Could you help me out?
18:40:34 §e[NPC] §6Sirius§f: §r§fI've always wanted to start a farm but instead I got sucked into this life of crim...I mean business!
18:40:37 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
18:40:38 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fHoly Mackerel! You got me the whole nine yards.
18:40:45 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §rHello §bSebbebas§f. Glad to meet you here. I need some §9Enchanted Melon Block§f.
18:40:47 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §r§fThis is not my realm. I must return. Thank you.
18:42:44 §e[NPC] §6Sirius§f: §r§fThis smell... it reminds me of my childhood when I used to pick flowers in the garden. Keep this between you and me, understand?
18:42:46 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fThank you very much! I'll make sure to give these extra ballots to only the elites!
18:42:47 §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §r§fMmh! This is really good! I'll be sure to come back again when I'm no longer busy!
