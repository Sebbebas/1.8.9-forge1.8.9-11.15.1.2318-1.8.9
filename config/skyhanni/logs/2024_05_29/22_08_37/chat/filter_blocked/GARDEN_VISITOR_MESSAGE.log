22:20:56 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
22:20:58 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §rEver wondered how I find all the things that other players lost? I outsource it. Right now, someone is looking for their §9Enchanted Red Mushroom Block§f. Can you find that for me?
22:25:34 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fGood choice!
22:30:41 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fDo Golden Carrots taste different than normal ones? I've actually never tried one before so I am pretty curious how they taste like.
22:30:42 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fLet's taste...THIS IS DISGUSTING!!! Why would anyone waste such precious gold on this? Just like any other fancy food, expensive and gross...
