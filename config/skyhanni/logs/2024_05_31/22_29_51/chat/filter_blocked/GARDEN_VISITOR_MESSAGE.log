01:18:05 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
01:18:08 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fMy wheat minion has been slacking recently, I am thinking about giving it an upgrade. He hasn't produced any wheat in years! Every time I check on him, he's empty.
01:18:08 §e[NPC] §aArthur§f: §r§fHoly Macaroni! That should boost my minion to at least Tier 5! Thank you a lot!
01:18:09 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
01:18:11 §e[NPC] §9Fragilis§f: §r§fHey you! Can you bring me the hardest block you can mine?
01:18:13 §e[NPC] §6Sirius§f: §r§fI've always wanted to start a farm but instead I got sucked into this life of crim...I mean business!
01:18:15 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?
01:18:16 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fQuite fascinating technology you have there, I'm sure with this machinery we could create even better appliances in the future!
01:19:55 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fEating enough of these surely should bring back my taste memories. Thank you.
01:19:56 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fPerfect! I'll share the good news with my village!
01:19:58 §e[NPC] §9Fragilis§f: §r§fCactus? I'm sure you could do better, but I'll take it for now.
01:19:59 §e[NPC] §6Sirius§f: §r§fThis smell... it reminds me of my childhood when I used to pick flowers in the garden. Keep this between you and me, understand?
